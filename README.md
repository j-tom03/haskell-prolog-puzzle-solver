# Haskell & Prolog Sunday Times Puzzle Solvers

This project contains solutions to four puzzles from *The Sunday Times*, solved in either Haskell or Prolog

The puzzles are as follows:
* Teaser 3172 - Haskell
* Teaser 3158 - Haskell
* Teaser 3145 - Prolog
* Teaser 3149 - Prolog

Each puzzle is solved using a *Tester-Generator* architecture. 

I completed this project whilst undertaking the ECM218 module at the University of Exeter - full PDF specification can be found in spec.pdf
